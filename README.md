## Start Configuration
We have created a start-up file which is included in this repo. "start_up_file.blend", if you would like to use 
the best "standard" configuration for working with videos in blender open the file. Press: File -> Defaults -> 
Save Startup File. This way the configuration will remain throughout different projects.
